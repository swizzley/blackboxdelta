**Global Market Trends:**

1. **Increasing demand for copper and gold:** The global market trends show a growing demand for copper and gold due to their various uses in industries like construction, electronics, and manufacturing. This creates a favorable market for Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., as it specializes in copper and gold exploration and development.

2. **Infrastructure development:** Many countries, especially emerging economies, are investing in infrastructure development, which requires significant amounts of copper and gold. Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. stands to benefit from this trend by supplying the necessary raw materials.

3. **Rising commodity prices:** Commodity prices, including copper and gold, have shown an upward trend in recent years. This can be advantageous for Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. as it can fetch higher prices for its products, leading to increased revenues and profits.

**Geopolitical Factors:**

1. **Limited global supply:** The global supply of copper and gold is limited, and their mining operations often face challenges related to political stability and regulatory hurdles. Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. could benefit from being a long-term player in these minerals due to its ability to engage in long-term mining operations.

2. **Potential disruption in key global mining regions:** Some of the world's major copper and gold mining regions, such as Chile and South Africa, face geopolitical risks like labor strikes, political uncertainties, and resource nationalization. These factors can disrupt the supply chain and make the market more favorable for Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. by offering a more stable alternative source.

3. **Strategic mining location:** Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. owns the Pebble Project in Alaska, which is strategically located in a politically stable country with a favorable mining regulatory environment. This positions the company well to capitalize on the growing demand for copper and gold, while minimizing geopolitical risks associated with operating in less stable regions.

4. **Relevant trade agreements and partnerships:** The geopolitical landscape of trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), can impact the market dynamics for mining companies. As Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. operates in North America, favorable trade agreements and partnerships can provide stability and enhanced market access.

It is important to note that geopolitical factors can be unpredictable and subject to change. Investors should conduct thorough research and monitor any significant geopolitical developments that may impact the market trends favoring Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.
