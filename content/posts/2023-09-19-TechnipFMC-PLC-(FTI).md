Impact on TechnipFMC PLC's long-term growth prospects:

1. Increased regulations in the oil and gas industry:
- Positive impact: Growing demand for renewable energy sources can create opportunities for TechnipFMC in the development and implementation of new technologies and solutions.
- Negative impact: Stricter regulations may increase costs for oil and gas companies, leading to reduced investments in new projects and limited growth potential for TechnipFMC in these sectors.

2. Stringent safety regulations and compliance requirements:
- Positive impact: TechnipFMC, with its strong focus on safety and compliance, is well-positioned to support oil and gas companies in meeting these requirements. This can enhance the company's reputation and attract new clients.
- Negative impact: The costs associated with safety measures and compliance can put pressure on TechnipFMC's profit margins, potentially impacting its long-term growth prospects.

3. Introduction of new trade policies and tariffs:
- Negative impact: Trade barriers and tariffs can disrupt the global supply chain and increase costs for TechnipFMC, potentially reducing its competitiveness and limiting its growth potential in international markets.
- Positive impact: Trade policies favoring domestic manufacturing can create opportunities for TechnipFMC to expand its operations in home markets, mitigating the negative impacts of global trade disruptions.

Overall, regulatory developments can have both positive and negative impacts on TechnipFMC PLC's long-term growth prospects. The company's ability to adapt to changing regulations, offer innovative solutions, and effectively manage costs will be critical in determining its future growth trajectory.
