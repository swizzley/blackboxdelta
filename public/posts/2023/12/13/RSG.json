Republic Services (RSG) CEO Jon Vander Ark tells Yahoo Finance that of 5 million items collected daily, plastics and cardboard dominate all which rely on fossil fuel usage for creation. While recyclables get reprocessed into products like carpets, Vander Ark notes these ultimately reach landfills too. However, Republic's new Las Vegas Polymer Center aims to achieve \"true circularity” — bottles remade endlessly into new bottles. Vander Ark says the facility will help overturn current shortages in sustainable recycling infrastructure. Alongside corporate and regulatory pressures around ESG, he describes the Polymer Center as pivotal for scaling the reuse of plastics.
