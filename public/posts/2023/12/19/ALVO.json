Hence, specific analysis of Alvotech SA's performance during this recovery period cannot be conducted."},{"section":"Conclusion","text":"To summarize, the historical performance of Alvotech SA stock during economic recessions and recoveries is largely dependent on the availability of relevant stock data. As Alvotech SA was founded in 2013, there is no historical stock data for the company during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 or the subsequent recovery period. Similarly, there is limited data available for assessing the company's performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
