During the expansion phase, economic growth is strong, and stock prices tend to rise. The peak phase is characterized by the market reaching a high point and investors becoming increasingly cautious. In the contraction phase, economic activity slows down, and stock prices decline. Finally, during the trough phase, the market reaches its lowest point before starting a new cycle."},{"section":"Impact of Market Cycles on OmniAb Inc Stock Prices","text":"As a biotechnology company, OmniAb Inc operates in a sector that is heavily influenced by market sentiment. During periods of economic expansion and investor optimism, the stock prices of biotechnology companies tend to rise. This can be attributed to increased funding for research and development, as well as higher investor confidence in the sector. Conversely, during economic contractions or market downturns, investor sentiment towards the biotech sector may turn negative, leading to decreased stock prices for companies like OmniAb Inc."},{"section":"Historical Examples of Market Cycles","text":"1. Dotcom Bubble (1997-2001): During the late 1990s, there was a surge in internet-related companies, leading to a speculative bubble. Stock prices of internet and technology companies soared to unprecedented levels. However, the bubble eventually burst in 2000, resulting in a sharp decline in stock prices.\n\n2. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009): The housing market collapse and subsequent financial crisis in 2008 were key factors in this market cycle. Stock prices plummeted as investor confidence waned, affecting companies across various sectors.\n\n3. COVID-19 Pandemic (2020): The global pandemic caused by the spread of the coronavirus resulted in a rapid market decline in early 2020. Many industries, including biotechnology, faced significant challenges as uncertainties and economic disruptions unfolded."},{"section":"Conclusion","text":"Market cycles play a crucial role in shaping stock prices, including those of OmniAb Inc. Understanding these cycles helps investors and analysts assess the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in the company.
