Like all publicly traded companies, the stock price of Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc can be affected by various factors, including changes in interest rates and monetary policy."},{"section":"Impact of Rising Interest Rates","text":"When interest rates rise, borrowing costs for companies such as Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc also increase. This can potentially lead to higher expenses and reduced profitability. As borrowing becomes more expensive, companies may be deterred from taking on new projects or making significant investments, which can negatively impact their growth prospects and stock price. Investors may perceive such a scenario as a sign of decreased profitability and therefore sell off their shares, causing the stock price to decline."},{"section":"Impact of Falling Interest Rates","text":"Conversely, when interest rates fall, companies like Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc can benefit from lower borrowing costs. This can lead to reduced expenses and improved profitability, as they can access capital more affordably. Lower interest rates can incentivize companies to invest in new projects, research and development, and other growth opportunities. Investors tend to view such circumstances positively, which can increase demand for the company's stock and drive its price higher."},{"section":"Monetary Policy and Market Sentiment","text":"Changes in monetary policy, particularly those made by central banks, can have a profound impact on market sentiment and investor behavior. When central banks implement expansionary monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates or implementing quantitative easing, it encourages borrowing and stimulates economic activity. This positive market sentiment can boost investor confidence and lead to increased buying activity, potentially driving up the stock price of companies like Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc."},{"section":"Conclusion","text":"Interest rates and monetary policy have substantial implications for Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc's stock price. Rising interest rates can increase borrowing costs and dampen profitability, which may lead to a decline in stock price.
