The vision of drone delivery has been around for years, with Amazon (AMZN) being one of the first to launch its drone delivery program “Prime Air” in 2013. What has kept the industry from scaling up to widespread use? Regulation. In the race to deliver at new heights, the FAA has granted Zipline a rare exception to fly drones beyond the visual line of sight. With commercial drone deliveries projected to exceed 1 million by the end of 2023, Zipline plans to lead the way introducing drone technology to as many as 15 cities in the US across healthcare, restaurants, and retail by 2025. Zipline expects to reach these goals with the company’s Platform 2 aircraft – a drone designed to seamlessly integrate into business operations while delivering with precision. From heights up to 330 feet, the drone drops a \"droid\" with packaged goods weighing up to eight pounds anywhere from your doorstep to sidewalk in a matter of minutes.Drone delivery could be introducing a new accessibility to delivery services with retailers lining up to utilize the technology. Sweetgreen (SG), Pagliacci Pizza, and Mendocino Farms are early restaurant adopters. Zipline has also lined up a slew of clients in the health and wellness space, including GNC, Michigan Medicine, Intermountain Health, and MultiCare Health System. As more companies adopt the technology, delivery on wheels may be a thing of the past.
