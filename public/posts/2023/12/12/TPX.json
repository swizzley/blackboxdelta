When the economy is strong and consumers have more disposable income, they are more likely to purchase mattresses and other bedding products, leading to increased demand for Tempur Sealy products. Conversely, during economic downturns or periods of low consumer confidence, consumers may postpone purchasing big-ticket items like mattresses, resulting in decreased demand for Tempur Sealy products."},{"section":"Interest rates","text":"Changes in interest rates can also impact Tempur Sealy International Inc stock's performance. Lower interest rates typically stimulate consumer spending and make financing options more affordable, which can boost the demand for big-ticket items like mattresses.
