To understand the reasons behind this decline, it is crucial to evaluate the company's debt and leverage ratios."},{"section":"Debt and Leverage Ratios","text":"Debt and leverage ratios provide insights into a company's financial health, risk level, and ability to repay debt. Two key ratios to consider are the Debt-to-Equity ratio and the Debt-to-Asset ratio."},{"section":"Debt-to-Equity Ratio","text":"The Debt-to-Equity ratio compares a company's total debt to its shareholders' equity. A high ratio suggests that the company relies heavily on debt financing. Ross Stores Inc's current Debt-to-Equity ratio is 0.92, indicating a higher level of debt compared to its equity."},{"section":"Debt-to-Asset Ratio","text":"The Debt-to-Asset ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets financed by debt. A higher ratio indicates higher financial risk. Ross Stores Inc has a Debt-to-Asset ratio of 0.52, implying that more than half of its assets are funded through debt."},{"section":"Contributing Factors to Stock Price Decline","text":"The high level of debt and leverage ratios contribute to several factors that have led to the decline in Ross Stores Inc's stock price. Firstly, high debt levels increase the company's financial risk and make investors wary. In uncertain economic times or during a market downturn, companies with significant debt may struggle to meet their obligations, leading to a sell-off of their stock."},{"section":"","text":"Secondly, high debt can impede a company's ability to invest in growth opportunities and innovation. In the retail industry, staying ahead of competitors requires constant reinvestment and adaptation to changing consumer preferences. However, companies burdened with excessive debt may find it challenging to allocate resources for research and development or expansion plans, ultimately hindering their competitiveness."},{"section":"","text":"Furthermore, high debt levels can lead to increased interest expenses. With a significant portion of earnings allocated to interest payments, the company's profitability may suffer. Investors often view declining profit margins unfavorably, causing them to sell their stock and driving the stock price down."},{"section":"Implications of High Debt Levels","text":"High debt levels can have dire consequences for a company. Not only do they increase financial risk and limit growth opportunities, but they can also result in credit rating downgrades. A downgrade can increase borrowing costs, making it even more challenging for the company to manage its debt."}],"tags":["OverBought","Short","Retail"],"news":[{"category":"company","date":1702311272,"headline":"Macy's (M) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why","id":124451903,"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sdftptXgfwNxcLCd.qezbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/stockstory_922/68c056e2a4f7952bfd482dc84b9b92a1","symbol":"ROST","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"Shares of department store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) jumped 18.2% in the morning session after reports from Reuters that Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital, an investor group, made a $5.8 billion offer to take the company private.

It's a crucial time for many retailers, with the term \"Black Friday\" referencing the point when retailers go from being \"in the red\" to being \"in the black.\" Storch Advisors Gerald \"Jerry\" Storch, the former CEO of both Toys R Us and Hudson's Bay, expresses caution over the high numbers reported during Cyber Week sales, stating that the growth likely came at the expense of brick-and-mortar sales. Although BMO Capital Markets Managing Director Simeon Siegel agrees about being watchful over retail reports, he feels “optimistic” that the holiday shopping season is off to a good start. The biggest question Siegel raises is how the retailers are going to perform during the lull between Cyber Week and Christmas. When it comes to the winners in retail, Siegel says those who “predict their demand well are going to continue to win, and those that don’t are going to continue to lose.” Storch projects that Walmart (WMT), TJX Companies (TJX), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST) will have a successful holiday shopping season. Siegel’s retail winners also include TJX Companies, as well as Ross Stores (ROST), Burlington (BURL), and Coach (owned by Tapestry (TPR)).For more from Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way series: Click here for more videos and tune in to Yahoo Finance every Thursday at 3 p.m. ET.
