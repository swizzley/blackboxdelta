This is because low inflation generally indicates a healthy economy with stable prices and increased consumer spending.

High inflation erodes the purchasing power of individuals, leading to decreased consumer spending and a slowdown in economic activity. As a result, ESSA Bancorp Inc may struggle to generate revenue and may face higher borrowing costs due to elevated interest rates, ultimately impacting the stock's value in a negative way."},{"section":"Interest Rates","text":"Global economic conditions, including inflation, often influence central banks' decisions regarding interest rates. When inflation is high, central banks tend to raise interest rates to curb spending and control inflationary pressures. Higher interest rates can negatively impact ESSA Bancorp Inc stock's value as borrowing becomes more expensive for businesses and individuals, potentially leading to reduced loan demand and lower profitability."},{"section":"Economic Sentiment","text":"Global economic conditions, such as inflation, can also impact overall market sentiment and investor confidence. If investors perceive inflation to be a threat to the economy, they may become more cautious and sell off stocks, including ESSA Bancorp Inc.
