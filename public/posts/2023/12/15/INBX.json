Increased Stringency: Regulatory authorities have been tightening their scrutiny and requirements for the approval of new drugs and therapies. This includes more rigorous clinical trials, safety assessments, and post-marketing surveillance. These increased regulatory standards can delay the commercialization of Inhibrx Inc's products, potentially impacting its revenue and, consequently, its stock valuation."},{"section":"2. Pricing and Reimbursement Policies: ","text":"Regulators, particularly healthcare authorities, play a significant role in determining the pricing and reimbursement policies for pharmaceutical products.

Changes in these policies, such as price controls or reimbursement restrictions, can affect sales volumes and overall financial performance, potentially leading to a decline in stock valuation."},{"section":"3. Patent Protection and Intellectual Property Rights: ","text":"Strong patent protection is crucial in the biotechnology sector, as it provides companies like Inhibrx Inc with a period of exclusivity to recoup research and development costs.
