Smucker (SJM), Sphere Entertainment (SPHR), Campbell Soup Company (CPB), Lovesac (LOVE), Lululemon (LULU), and GitLab (GTLB). Yahoo Finance spoke to CEOs, experts, and analysts to break down everything investors need to know, including the winners and losers from this week's results. J.M. Smucker (00:00:03): J.M. Smucker posted better-than-expected results for its fiscal second quarter. J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker broke down the company results. \"Our entire portfolio is actually performing exceptionally well,\" Smucker said. \"Recently though we actually took a price decline on coffee because commodity costs have come down, and that takes a little pressure off the consumer.\" Sphere Entertainment (00:00:22): Sphere Entertainment, the owner of the Las Vegas Sphere, posted adjusted income in its first public quarter since the venue opened. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal discussed the company expectations. Canal said, \"Even though it's only been in operation for a little over two months, its U2 residency has had a lot of success, along with the Darren Aronofsky film 'Postcard From Earth.' Combined those events have brought in more than $75 million for the company so far.\" Campbell Soup Company (00:00:55): Campbell Soup Company beat analyst expectations when it reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings. Campbell Soup CEO Mark Clouse broke down the quarterly results. Clouse said, \"We were lapping the best quarter certainly I had since I had been here of a 15 percent growth rate, and it was a monster quarter as it related to soup in particular.\" Lovesac (00:01:20): Lovesac posted a 14.3% year-over-year growth in net sales and 36.3% year-over-year rise in gross profit in the third quarter. Lovesac CEO Shawn Nelson discussed the company outlook. \"It's unique for the home category because we're experiencing a big hangover after Covid,\" Nelson said. \"But then again it's unique for Lovesac because we've been on such an uptick as we've built the brand over these past few years very intensely and had a lot of success.\" Lululemon (00:01:58): Lululemon reported third-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines, but the fourth quarter revenue guidance was short of expectations. Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer Senior Analyst, broke down future growth potential for the company. \"I think you had a pretty nice beat in the third quarter,\" Nagel said. \"They gave specific guidance for Q4, which is slightly below the Street. There's nothing in this support that suggests to me that the underlying business of Lululemon is slowing.\" GitLab (00:02:27): GitLab made a profit in the third quarter and raised guidance. GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij discussed the company's stronger-than-expected results. Sijbrandij said, \"Every company has to get better at making software. Companies are seeing that they now have like 15 different tools to create software, and they have to hop between each and every one of them to get it out the door. We consolidate that into one platform.\" Video highlights: 00:00:03 - J.M.
