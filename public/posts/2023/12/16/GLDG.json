As a mining company, its stock value is closely tied to the global economic conditions, especially factors like inflation."},{"section":"Inflation and Gold Prices","text":"Inflation refers to the general increase in prices of goods and services over time. Gold is often considered a hedge against inflation as it has historically retained its value even during periods of rising prices."},{"section":"Positive Impact of Inflation","text":"When inflation pressures rise, investors may turn to gold as a safe haven investment.
