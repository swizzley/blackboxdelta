This can result in a decline in the multinational stock value as investors anticipate lower earnings. For example, if the US dollar strengthens against the euro, the company's European operations' earnings would be worth less when converted to dollars."},{"section":"Case Study 2: Weakening home currency","text":"On the other hand, a weakening home currency can benefit Allied Gaming \u0026 Entertainment Inc. When the domestic currency depreciates, the multinational company's foreign currency earnings increase when converted back. This can lead to an increase in profits and potentially boost the stock value. For instance, if the Japanese yen weakens against the US dollar, the company's Japanese operations' earnings would be worth more in dollars."},{"section":"Case Study 3: Diversified currency exposure","text":"Allied Gaming \u0026 Entertainment Inc's multinational operations often involve diversification across various countries, resulting in exposure to multiple currencies. This diversification can mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the stock. If some currencies depreciate while others strengthen, the overall effect on the stock may be less significant.
