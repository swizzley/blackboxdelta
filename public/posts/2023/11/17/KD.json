As a multinational corporation, Kyndryl's financial performance is susceptible to changes in global economic growth rates, as it operates in various countries and industries."},{"section":"Revenue Impact","text":"Changes in global economic growth rates can significantly impact Kyndryl's revenue. During periods of robust economic growth, companies tend to increase their investments in technology services, leading to higher demand for Kyndryl's offerings.
