The company also issued better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledges there were some headwinds Intel was facing when he took the job, and his goal was to \"rebuild this iconic company.\" With the latest results, he says \"people can see the momentum is building\" at Intel thanks to cost-saving initiatives, product execution, and its internal foundry model. Intel plans to launch new products including the Core Ultra processor, which Gelsinger nicknamed the \"AI PC\". Gelsinger says the AI PC aims to keep users from having to go to the cloud to utilize AI, instead, the features and data are readily available on the device itself to improve productivity. Gelsinger says these products will help Intel capitalize on the \"surge in AI interest we're seeing across the board.\" With new products slated to launch over the next two years in its data center unit, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger believes the chipmaker can regain lost market share and boost competitiveness, stating 2024 is when Intel will \"start gaining back share\" thanks to its upcoming product releases. \"Intel is back in the data center, winning share, better products, better execution,\" Gelsinger tells Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, adding \"our customers are starting to see us and give us credit for that.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/intels-momentum-building-big-q3-201907179.html"},{"category":"company","date":1698437774,"headline":"Intel Stock Rallies As PC Market Shows Signs Of Recovery","id":123466784,"image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/ibd.com/5a8e430b7d567919b0c8a47910d71cae","symbol":"INTC","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"Intel stock jumped on Friday after the chipmaker delivered better-than-expected results for the third quarter and guided higher.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/m/105829aa-2418-3a3d-8852-6e6148e14055/intel-stock-rallies-as-pc.html"},{"category":"company","date":1698437081,"headline":"Intel Shares Pop After Foundry Revenue Quadrupled Amid Rising Demand for AI Chips","id":123466785,"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xTKh7LBIa.Dq3xN6X.enOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investopedia.com/0830e25e34ac79f47fd4c5bb281d4351","symbol":"INTC","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"Intel shares jumped Friday after the tech company’s third-quarter earnings beat estimates, in part driven by gains in its foundry business and surging interest in artificial intelligence, as well as signs of a recovery in the PC market.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/m/465c7599-5ae3-3e3f-ba4e-e96190ad0421/intel-shares-pop-after.html"},{"category":"company","date":1698430553,"headline":"The Federal Carrier Wave Continues To Drive Intel Stock Higher","id":123461555,"image":"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1469501056/image_1469501056.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536","symbol":"INTC","publisher":"SeekingAlpha","summary":"Intel's debt load is material, but not likely to be a concern to lenders, nor therefore should it be to shareholders.
