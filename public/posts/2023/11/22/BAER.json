Tensions between countries or geopolitical conflicts can create uncertainty in the global market, leading to higher levels of investor caution. In such situations, investors may become hesitant to invest in companies with significant international exposure, including Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings Inc. This can result in a decline in the company's stock price, as the perceived risk increases and the demand for shares diminishes."},{"section":"Geopolitical Stability","text":"Geopolitical stability is crucial for businesses operating in the global market.
