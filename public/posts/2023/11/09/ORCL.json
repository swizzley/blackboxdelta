Chambers insists that AI is essential, stating “those companies that get AI right are going to see explosive growth.\" Investors are making “careful selection[s]” and in order to stand out, there has to be a strong incorporation strategy, Chambers notes, later echoing \"this is the decade of AI\" and the trend shouldn't be a cause for concern or fear.
