The company has faced several price hikes for its food in the past several years but customer base and growth remain strong, opening 62 new restaurants during the quarter. Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung joins Yahoo Finance anchors Seana Smith and Diane King Hall and Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss Chipotle's position and how the fast-casual restaurant has retained customers and value despite price hikes. When asked about price increases during inflationary periods, Hartung explains: \"Our current food and labor inflation is running at about 3-4%. Our strategy has always been just to keep up, or maybe stay a little bit behind inflation. We don't want to build our business or grow margins based on inflation. We want to grow our margins based on transaction growth.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/chipotle-remains-strong-despite-price-151607325.html"},{"category":"company","date":1698418832,"headline":"Morgan Stanley Maintains Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Equal-Weight Recommendation","id":123451522,"image":"","symbol":"CMG","publisher":"Fintel","summary":"","url":"https://fintel.io/news/morgan-stanley-maintains-chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg-equal-weight-recommendation-531"},{"category":"company","date":1698418828,"headline":"Stephens \u0026 Co.
