Accenture's stock price took a significant hit, dropping from around $46 in mid-2007 to a low of $23 in early 2009. This decline was primarily driven by a decrease in demand for consulting and technology services due to widespread economic turmoil."},{"section":"Global Financial Crisis (2008)","text":"In 2008, the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers had a substantial impact on Accenture's stock price. The stock experienced a sharp decline, reaching a low of $23 in March 2009. This drop was a result of investor panic and a general lack of confidence in the global economy."},{"section":"Dot-Com Bubble Burst (2000-2002)","text":"The dot-com bubble burst, which occurred from 2000 to 2002, had a significant impact on Accenture's stock price. As many technology companies failed during this period, investors lost confidence in the sector. Accenture's stock price declined from around $40 in early 2000 to a low of $6 in mid-2002. This decline reflected the broader market sentiment and the bursting of the speculative bubble surrounding internet-based companies."},{"section":"Post-COVID Recovery (2020-2021)","text":"Following the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Accenture's stock price displayed resilience and recovered swiftly. Accenture's stock price experienced a sharp decline in March 2020, reaching a low of around $137. However, as the markets started to recover, the stock rebounded strongly and reached new all-time highs. By late 2021, Accenture's stock price was trading above $340, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to navigate challenging market conditions."},{"section":"General Market Rallies","text":"During general market rallies, Accenture's stock price typically benefits from increased investor optimism and a positive economic outlook. For example, during the bull market of the late 1990s, Accenture's stock price experienced significant growth, reaching a peak of around $120 in early 2000. Similarly, during periods of economic expansion and bull markets, Accenture's stock price tends to perform well."},{"section":"Conclusion","text":"Accenture's stock price has been influenced by various market events throughout history. Crashes, such as the Great Recession and the dot-com bubble burst, led to significant declines in Accenture's stock price. However, the company has also shown resilience and the ability to recover during market recoveries, such as the post-COVID period. Overall, Accenture's stock price performance reflects broader market trends and investor sentiment."}],"tags":["LongSignals","Long","Technology"],"news":[{"category":"company","date":1700110860,"headline":"Only a Fifth of Companies on Track for Net Zero, with Heavy Industry Key to Breaking Decarbonization Stalemate, Accenture Reports Find","id":123909760,"image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/7e239f810d9b31efa67b2325c0d2a717","symbol":"ACN","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"NEW YORK, November 16, 2023--Fewer than one in five companies (18%) are currently on track to reach net zero emissions in their operations by 2050, says Accenture.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-fifth-companies-track-net-050100736.html"},{"category":"company","date":1700100540,"headline":"Accenture to Acquire Solnet to Expand Cloud First Capabilities in Aotearoa New Zealand","id":123909761,"image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/460eec79ed3a673cdad16192864c1794","symbol":"ACN","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"WELLINGTON, New Zealand, November 16, 2023--Accenture has agreed to acquire Solnet, an IT services provider with deep technology consulting experience.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/accenture-acquire-solnet-expand-cloud-020900806.html"},{"category":"company","date":1700078340,"headline":"Accenture and Avanade Expand Capabilities to Accelerate Data Readiness and Generative AI Adoption with Microsoft Technology","id":123909762,"image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/bed2cd2a679e7a35a65d20b1c28b145e","symbol":"ACN","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"NEW YORK, November 15, 2023--Accenture and Avanade have launched new offerings applying Microsoft Fabric to help organizations accelerate data readiness.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/accenture-avanade-expand-capabilities-accelerate-195900214.html"},{"category":"company","date":1700049600,"headline":"Companies Tried to Spend Less on Cloud.
