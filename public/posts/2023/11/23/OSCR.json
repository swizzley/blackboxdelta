The Canadian dollar appreciated significantly against the US dollar during this period. As a result, Oscar Health Inc experienced a rise in its stock value when the profits from its Canadian operations were converted back into US dollars. This currency fluctuation provided a boost to the company's multinational stock."},{"section":"Case Study 2: Currency Depreciation","text":"In contrast, in 2020, Oscar Health Inc faced challenges due to currency depreciation. The company had operations in the United Kingdom, and the British pound depreciated against the US dollar. As a result, when the profits from its UK operations were converted back into US dollars, the value decreased. This depreciation impacted the company's multinational stock negatively."},{"section":"Balanced Assessment","text":"Currency fluctuations carry both risks and opportunities for multinational companies like Oscar Health Inc. A strengthening currency can increase the value of profits when converted back into the home currency, leading to a positive impact on stock value. Conversely, a weakening currency can decrease profits and negatively affect stock value. It is essential for multinational companies to manage currency risk through hedging strategies, such as forward contracts or currency options, to mitigate the potential negative impacts. Additionally, maintaining a diversified portfolio of operations across various currencies can help offset the effects of currency fluctuations."},{"section":"","text":""},{"section":"","text":""},{"section":"","text":""},{"section":"","text":""},{"section":"","text":""}],"tags":["CrossOver55","Long","Insurance"],"news":[{"category":"company","date":1700554560,"headline":"What's Driving Oscar Health Inc's Surprising 21.76% Stock Rally?","id":124022023,"image":"","symbol":"OSCR","publisher":"GuruFocus","summary":"Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?
