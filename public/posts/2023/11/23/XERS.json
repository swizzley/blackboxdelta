Therefore, changes in commodity prices can have a significant impact on the company's overall expenses and ultimately affect its stock performance."},{"section":"Effects of Commodity Price Volatility","text":"Commodity price volatility refers to the rapid and unpredictable fluctuations in the prices of raw materials. These fluctuations can occur due to various factors such as supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and market speculation. For companies like Xeris Biopharma that heavily rely on raw materials, commodity price volatility can present both challenges and opportunities."},{"section":"Challenges","text":"A sudden increase in commodity prices can result in higher production costs for Xeris Biopharma.
