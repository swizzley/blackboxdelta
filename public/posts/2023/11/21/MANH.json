This led to a decrease in the reported revenues and earnings of Manhattan Associates Inc, as the company's European operations were negatively impacted by the currency exchange rates. The stock price of Manhattan Associates Inc also experienced a decline as investors were concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on the company's financial performance."},{"section":"Case Study 2: Weakening currency","text":"Conversely, a weakening currency can benefit Manhattan Associates Inc. In 2018, the Brazilian real experienced a significant depreciation against the U.S. dollar. As a multinational company with operations in Brazil, Manhattan Associates Inc benefited from the currency devaluation. The company's reported revenues and earnings increased, and the stock price also rose as investors saw the positive impact of the currency fluctuations on the company's financials."},{"section":"Assessment of currency risk","text":"Currency fluctuations can pose both opportunities and risks for Manhattan Associates Inc multinational stock. The main risk is that currency movements can unpredictably affect the company's revenues, expenses, and profitability. When the domestic currency strengthens against foreign currencies, it can reduce the value of the company's international sales and earnings when converted into the domestic currency. On the other hand, a weaker domestic currency can boost the company's international sales and earnings when converted into the domestic currency. Therefore, currency risk management becomes crucial for multinational companies like Manhattan Associates Inc."},{"section":"Balancing currency risk:","text":"To mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations, Manhattan Associates Inc can employ various strategies. One approach is to implement hedging techniques, such as forwards or options, to protect against currency volatility. This helps to stabilize the company's cash flows and mitigate potential losses. Additionally, the company can also optimize its operations by diversifying its revenue sources across different countries. This reduces reliance on a single currency and minimizes the impact of fluctuations in any one currency. Overall, a carefully managed approach to currency risk enables Manhattan Associates Inc to navigate the uncertain currency markets and maintain a stable stock performance."}],"tags":["LongSignals","Long","Technology"],"news":[{"category":"company","date":1700465490,"headline":"NORGESGRUPPEN PICKS MANHATTAN TO SUPPORT GROWTH OF ITS PREMIUM SUPERMARKET BRAND MENY","id":123991781,"image":"","symbol":"MANH","publisher":"Finnhub","summary":"The post NORGESGRUPPEN PICKS MANHATTAN TO SUPPORT GROWTH OF ITS PREMIUM SUPERMARKET BRAND MENY appeared first on PR Fire.LONDON, UK. - Manhattan Associates Inc. today announced that Norway's...","url":"https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e625f64d6db9cfae5eccef24ea6a6310f8220791b6b93583b60dadd0ff9e152b"},{"category":"company","date":1700465220,"headline":"D.A.
