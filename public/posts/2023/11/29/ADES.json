In some cases, the consolidation has strengthened their position by enabling them to offer a broader range of products and services, access new customer bases, and achieve economies of scale.

Companies are actively seeking to expand their capabilities and market reach, indicating a positive outlook for the industry. This growth is driven by increasing environmental regulations, the need for cleaner and more sustainable solutions, and the potential for substantial business opportunities.
