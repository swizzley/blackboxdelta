Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the retail industry to discuss everything investors need to know, including the winners and losers from this week's results. Home Depot (00:00:10) Home Depot shares traded higher after the retailer reported third-quarter results that beat analyst expectations. Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst at D.A. Davidson Michael Baker said, \"Expectations were low, but this is pretty much as we had expected when we lowered our numbers in front of the quarter.\" Target (00:00:23) Target profit surged 36% to $971 million in the third quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations. But sales fell during the quarter as consumers reduced discretionary spending. Aptus Capital Equity Analyst and Portfolio Manager David Wagner said, \"The margin profile, it seems like there was a low quality beat there off of lowered expectations.\" Meanwhile, UBS US Hardline \u0026 Broadline and Food Retail Analyst Michael Lasser broke down the market outlook for Target. Lasser explained, \"The market is saying just think about what Target can do once the sales turn, and that's driving the reaction that you're seeing in the stock.\" Macy's (00:01:02) Macy's saw a small boost after posting its third-quarter earnings, but sales fell by 7% year-over-year. TD Cowen Research Analyst Oliver Chen said, \"Expectations were fairly low and the numbers were better than feared. \" Walmart (00:01:29) Walmart beat third-quarter earnings estimates but softened its guidance for the remainder of the year, claiming cautious optimism for the upcoming holiday season. Piper Sandler Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Ed Yruma explained, \"They would argue that if we get deflation then that's more money that the consumer can spend elsewhere and hopefully spend at Walmart. But I think it's just a different shift that the investors are trying to grapple with.\" Gap (00:01:59) Gap reported third-quarter earnings that beat analyst forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, though comparable sales fell. CRFA Analyst Zachary Warring said, \"They're definitely going in the right direction ... but we'd like to see Gap and Banana Republic sales stabilize, and then also Athleta.\" Video highlights: 00:00:03 - Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer 00:00:10 - Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst at D.A.
