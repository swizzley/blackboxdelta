As an international corporation, Apyx Medical Corp relies on global trade for the sourcing of raw materials and components, as well as the distribution of its products to various markets worldwide."},{"section":"Supply Chain Vulnerability","text":"Trade restrictions or tariffs imposed on Apyx Medical Corp's key trading partners could disrupt its supply chain.

Disruptions in the supply chain, limitations on market access, and stock price volatility are among the key risks associated with changes in international trade policies. The company's proactive approach in mitigating these risks through diversification and strategic planning will be crucial in maintaining its competitiveness and sustaining long-term growth."}],"tags":["CrossUnder200","Short","Health Care"],"news":[{"category":"company","date":1699643323,"headline":"Apyx Medical Corporation (NASDAQ:APYX) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript","id":123799023,"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n_8bNm0jJNFFaaHX4o9mrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzM-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/a48b3841b171193fb2453e900d1a7ad3","symbol":"APYX","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"Apyx Medical Corporation (NASDAQ:APYX) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 9, 2023 Apyx Medical Corporation misses on earnings expectations.
