These cycles are driven by various factors such as economic conditions, investor sentiment, and market psychology. They consist of four primary phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. During expansion, the markets grow, stock prices rise, and economic indicators improve. At the peak, the market reaches its highest point, and stock prices may be overvalued. Contraction occurs when the market starts declining, stock prices fall, and economic indicators weaken. The trough marks the lowest point of the cycle, and the market begins to recover."},{"section":"Influence of Market Cycles on First Business Financial Services Inc","text":"First Business Financial Services Inc, being a publicly traded company, is influenced by market cycles.
