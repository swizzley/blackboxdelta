This assessment analyzes real-world case studies to assess the impact of currency fluctuations on Innovid's stock and provides a balanced assessment of currency risk."},{"section":"Case Study 1: Currency Depreciation","text":"In 2018, Innovid Corp's stock experienced a decline in value due to a currency depreciation in the country where one of its key markets is located.
