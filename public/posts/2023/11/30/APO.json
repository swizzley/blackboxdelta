These changes can impact the company's operations, profitability, and investor sentiment, thereby influencing its stock market performance."},{"section":"Government Bailouts or Stimulus Packages","text":"During times of economic crisis or financial instability, governments often implement bailout programs or stimulus packages to stabilize the economy.
