The rise of e-commerce, mobile apps, and social media platforms has given consumers unprecedented convenience and choice.

This shift in consumer behavior has affected Frontline Plc's revenue and profitability, leading to a decline in stock performance."},{"section":"Demographics and Consumer Preferences","text":"Demographic changes, such as an aging population or a rise in urbanization, have also influenced consumer preferences. For example, as the population ages, there is an increased demand for healthcare and wellness products. If Frontline Plc fails to adapt to these changing preferences and cater to the needs of the growing elderly population, it may experience a decline in sales and subsequent decrease in stock value."},{"section":"Consumption Patterns and Product Innovation","text":"Consumption patterns have shifted significantly in recent years.
