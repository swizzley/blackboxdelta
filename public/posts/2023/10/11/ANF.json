Changing Consumer Behavior","text":"The rise of technology and e-commerce has significantly changed consumer behavior, shifting towards online shopping and digital experiences. This change poses a significant challenge for traditional retailers like Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch, which heavily rely on physical stores and in-person shopping experiences. As a result, the company may experience declining sales and foot traffic in their brick-and-mortar stores."},{"section":"2. E-commerce Competition","text":"The increasing popularity of e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, poses a threat to traditional retailers. These platforms offer a wide range of products, competitive pricing, and convenience, attracting a significant portion of consumers. Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch may face stiff competition from online players, potentially impacting its market share and profitability."},{"section":"3.
