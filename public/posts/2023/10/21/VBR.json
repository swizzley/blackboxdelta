When consumers have more disposable income and feel confident about the economy, they are likely to spend more on discretionary items. This increased spending can positively impact VBR's stock performance as the company's revenues and profits grow."},{"section":"Economic Conditions and Spending Patterns","text":"The state of the economy plays a crucial role in shaping consumer discretionary spending.
