The technology is expected to add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy, according to a McKinsey study. With the excitement surrounding new AI applications in software, investors are betting big on the companies revolutionizing the space. D.A. Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Tom Forte and Roth MKM Managing Director Rohit Kulkarni join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss their picks and what investors should be looking for. As the “Godfather of AI,” Alphabet-parent Google (GOOGL, GOOG) is a top pick for Kulkarni, who said that because the company is currently behind Microsoft in the roll out of AI features, they are at an advantage considering they have undergone “evolutions of developing consumer-use cases unlike many others.” Viewed as a technology company focused on home e-commerce, Wayfair (W) is Forte’s “wildcard” AI investment. According to Forte, the company is leveraging AI with enhancements like their product-identifying feature that allows consumers to search for an item in their extensive product catalog by taking a photo.

However, with increasing interest and innovations in AI and the cloud from tech giants - like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) - some investors are looking towards the tech sector for potential future profits. Wedbush Managing Director Scott Devitt joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what he thinks about opportunities in the tech sector despite worries of a recession. Devitt defends his bullish outlook, saying \"these companies have proven themselves in terms of continuing to be secular growth stories. We have another cycle that we're in the first inning of in AI, and so we're very optimistic on the group overall.\" When it comes to companies that best stand to benefit from generative AI, Devitt points to Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) are the clearest beneficiaries, but also companies like Booking Holdings (BKNG) which could benefit from how AI can enhance the company's offerings.
