      "section": "Economic Recessions",
      "text": "During economic recessions, the demand for energy products and services tends to decrease. This can negatively impact the performance of Halliburton Co stock. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis and recession, Halliburton Co's stock price experienced a significant decline. From a peak price of around $54 in mid-2008, the stock plummeted to around $12 by early 2009. This decline was driven by reduced investment in energy projects and a slowdown in the overall economy."

    {
      "section": "Economic Recoveries",
      "text": "As the economy recovers from a recession, the demand for energy products and services typically increases. This can have a positive impact on the performance of Halliburton Co stock. During economic recoveries, Halliburton Co's stock price historically tends to rebound and show growth. For instance, after the 2008 recession, as the economy started to recover, Halliburton Co stock gradually climbed back up. By 2011, the stock price had regained its pre-recession levels."

These include oil prices, global energy demand, government policies, and the company's financial health. For example, during recessions, a drop in oil prices can negatively impact Halliburton Co's stock price due to reduced profitability. Conversely, during recoveries, increasing oil prices and higher energy demand can contribute to positive performance."
