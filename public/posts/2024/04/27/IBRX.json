Soon-Shiong says that Anktiva will be \"the next generation of immuno-therapy.\" He claims the drug is the first of its kind to \"generate complete remission that's completely durable\" for 47 months and longer. Soon-Shiong believes the drug will serve as \"a backbone\" to \"checkpoint inhibitors,\" a class of immunotherapy drugs. He envisions the drug's potential to target cancers regardless of their location within the body, describing it as \"an opportunity to use this as a fundamental platform across all tumor types.\" Soon-Shiong says he, alongside other entities, collectively invested around $400 million in the company when the drug was first rejected. He further notes that additional investments totaling $100 million are forthcoming, stating, \"the company is stable in terms of cash capabilities,\"— hoping for a commercial launch of Anktiva in May.
