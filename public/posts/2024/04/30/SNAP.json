Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Technology, Media, and Telecom Scott Kessler joins Yahoo Finance to provide better insight into Snap's results. Snap shares are blasting off in Thursday after-hours trading. Kessler characterizes Snap's first quarter as \"a rollercoaster,\" acknowledging that while the stock is up, \"there's been a lot of volatility\" to the downside. He attributes the company's success to its focus on \"rearchitecting their advertising technology infrastructure,\" enabling them to effectively monetize e-commerce opportunities. Kessler highlights Snap's efforts to grow its user base \"outside of developed markets\" as another strategic priority. However, he notes that these markets are \"much harder to monetize,\" describing the challenge as \"not an easy nut to crack.\" Nonetheless, Kessler remains optimistic, finding that investors \"should feel pretty good about the performance and the outlook.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance.
