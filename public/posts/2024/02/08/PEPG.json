These cycles consist of four primary phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. During the expansion phase, the market experiences sustained growth, leading to rising stock prices. The peak represents the turning point when the market reaches its highest point before entering the contraction phase. In this phase, stock prices decline as investors start selling off their shares. The contraction phase eventually leads to a trough, which is the lowest point in the market cycle. After the trough, the market begins to recover, leading to a new expansion phase."},{"section":"Influence on PepGen Inc Stock Prices","text":"PepGen Inc, like other stocks, is influenced by market cycles. During the expansion phase, when the overall market is growing, PepGen Inc stock prices are likely to rise due to investor optimism and increased demand. Conversely, during the contraction phase, the stock prices may decline as investors sell off their shares in response to a downturn in the market. The impact of market cycles on PepGen Inc stock prices is not entirely uniform and may be influenced by company-specific factors."},{"section":"Historical Examples of Market Cycles","text":"1. Dotcom Bubble (1995-2001): During this period, the rapid growth of internet-based companies led to a speculative bubble. Stock prices skyrocketed during the expansion phase, but eventually collapsed, resulting in substantial losses for investors of technology stocks.\n\n2. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009): Triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis, this market cycle caused a severe global recession. Stock prices plummeted during the contraction phase, leading to a significant decline in the value of financial stocks and many other industries.\n\n3. Bull Market (2009-2020): Following the recession, the market entered a long period of expansion. Stock prices consistently rose, driven by factors such as economic recovery, low-interest rates, and increasing investor confidence."}],"tags":["CrossOver21","Long","Biotechnology"],"news":[{"category":"company","date":1707309000,"headline":"PepGen Announces Pricing of $80.1 Million Underwritten Offering of Common Stock","id":125618100,"image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/e0daac415005145303911dbaa51684e6","symbol":"PEPG","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"BOSTON, Feb. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PepGen Inc.
