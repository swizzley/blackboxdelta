Retail spending was up for the month of December 2023, but was that for the holidays, or is there something else at play? Marketguage.com Chief Strategist Michele Schneider argues that \"revenge spending\" in self-care and beauty products — coined as vanity stocks — was a result of consumer savings during early inflation, which may continue into 2024. Schneider joins Yahoo Finance to discuss why investors should keep an eye on several vanity-based stocks in 2024, particularly in clothing, cosmetics, and home exercise products.  \"The fact that last year the market really depended on the consumer and where did the consumer go? Did a lot of traveling, a lot of eating out, and emerged from the doldrums with a YOLO attitude, you only live once,\" Schneider elaborates. \"As I started to see those trends change, I started to realize I was talking to more and more people — not just women — but men and women who were talking about... 'this year I want to take care of myself more.'\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
