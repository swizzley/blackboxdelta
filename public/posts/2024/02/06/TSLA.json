What would he want to move Tesla to the \"Lone Star State\"? Ann Lipton, Tulane Law Associate Professor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this move could look like for the EV giant—and why Delaware has been a popular state for incorporation. Lipton explains that Delaware became a preferred choice in the early 1900s, and that due to its courts and its offering of “a very up-to-date corporate law that responds to the latest trends,” it has maintained that status. Delaware is unique in that it has a specialized court that hears business disputes only—where only chancellors who are experts preside. This system, according to Lipton allows for “reliable decisions,” in a shorter time. Delaware has been able to create a “network effect,” notes Lipton, who states that precedence has been set to the point that generally outcomes are clear and easier to reach. Acknowledging Nevada as a comparable to Delaware in some ways, Lipton sees it as “attractive” to some, but flexibility and freedom is limited for investors. “Nevada has carved out a little niche for itself,” according to Lipton. Speaking on the process to incorporate in Texas, Lipton expects there would be “some hold ups.\" Lipton does not see Musk gaining any wiggle-room apart from the greater possibility of “friendly judges” in Texas, and states that “it's definitely a risky move,” for Musk.

Tesla rode cheap capital, technological breakthroughs and Elon Musk's outsized persona to a $1-trillion valuation - but only after years of heavy spending before turning a profit.  Now legacy automakers, startups and investors that bet more than $1.2 trillion on EVs face increasingly tough decisions to cut losses.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-volvos-polestar-troubles-signal-172525305.html"},{"category":"company","date":1706808093,"headline":"Big Tech may have issues 'hitting some numbers,' strategist says","id":125453132,"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jkDJbSNVCbijiXgwxmZEug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-01/3d4b3530-c11f-11ee-be5f-da6f55df2b08","symbol":"TSLA","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"As some Big Tech companies prepare to release earnings on Thursday, Victoria Fernandez of Crossmark Global Investments weighs in on growth prospects. She believes \"there's going to be some difficulty, I think, in hitting some numbers that continue to make the stocks move higher,\" given lofty expectations. Fernandez explains that stocks like the tech giants have already priced in anticipated gains from areas like AI monetization. This helps explain disappointing results from names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently. Of the tech titans, she sees Apple (AAPL) as most worrisome for investors, since it has been \"down versus the rest of that Magnificent Seven for a while,\" and faces a \"tricky\" path to meet forecasts. Given high valuations, Fernandez notes she has been \"trimming\" tech holdings, advising investors not to \"go all in\" on those stocks. However, she singles out Microsoft as a top tech pick thanks to strengths in AI, cash flow, and balance sheet. Watch the video above to hear what Fernandez has to say about investing in Amazon.
