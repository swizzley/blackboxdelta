According to the Hollywood Reporter, 2024 was the worst weekend in over three decades, outside of 2021. Stacy Spikes, MoviePass Co-Founder and CEO, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the disappointing weekend for the box office and how it impacts his company. When asked about how to boost users to platform when there are not a lineup of movies getting people to theaters, Spikes replies: \"The major tentpoles aren't the drivers in people wanting a subscription platform where they're going to experiment more. We find they're actually more interested in the independent titles, and that's where the experimentation happens... With the Dunes and the Spider-Mans and the IMAX titles, that really wouldn't change our business. It's just not enough of those titles, but it's all of the smaller ones like we saw with Origin, we saw with Poor Things a lot of the Oscar nominees. That's where, you know 75% of our members are under the age of 35 and they like to experiment.\" When it comes to profitability, Spikes notes the company has benefiting from both the use of AI and its new credit system.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
