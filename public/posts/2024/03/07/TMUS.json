AT\u0026T addressed the concerns and claimed to have restored service to its customers. The company did not, however, address what caused the outage. Hugh Odom, Vertical Consultants Founder and President, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the recent outage from telecommunications companies and what could be behind the incident. Odom suggests part of the reason behind these outages could be the recent rollout of 5G coverage from providers and their troubling lack of infrastructure:\"We have a lack of cell sites [in] the United States to accommodate 5G. That's just the simple fact of it. We are lagging behind the rest of the world. Unless we build out more cell towers and upgrade the ones that are out there, we're going to see this continual issue both in urban and more particularly in rural areas where you have the spread of coverage. And the big issue there is AT\u0026T recently said they're going to get rid of landlines and most of rural America depends on those landlines for emergency services, and without wireless service what do you turn to?\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
