Financial Crisis of 2008","text":"During the financial crisis of 2008, AIG suffered significant losses and its stock price plummeted. This was due to its exposure to risky mortgage-backed securities. The broader economic trend of the crisis led to a decline in investor confidence, which impacted AIG's stock performance."},{"section":"2. COVID-19 Pandemic","text":"The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound effect on the global economy, and AIG was not immune to its impact. As the pandemic led to lockdowns and reduced economic activity, AIG's business operations were negatively affected, leading to a decline in its stock price."},{"section":"3. Interest Rate Changes","text":"Changes in interest rates can influence the performance of AIG stock. For example, when interest rates are low, it becomes more challenging for insurance companies like AIG to generate sufficient returns on their investments.
