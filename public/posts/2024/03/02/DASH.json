CEO Simon Khalaf joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he believes the company is \"still on track.\" Khalaf explains Marqeta's core business –– card issuing and processing and dispute management services –– comprise the bulk of their client offerings. He adds that Marqeta works beyond financial services alone, with \"embedded finance customers\" also a component of the company's sales. As the industry expands and competition increases, Khalaf says Marqeta aims to move into a space in the market where there are \"only the new players, not the established players.\" He sees a key opportunity to focus the company's efforts on the \"issuing side\" of the embedded finance space –– an area with little competition currently.
