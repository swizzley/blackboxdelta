Citi Leisure Analyst James Hardiman joins Yahoo Finance for the latest edition of Travel Guide 2024: Industry Insights. He breaks down the pricing momentum following a strong fourth quarter.  Hardiman further details which regions have the best performance for cruises: \"I think geographically the Caribbean is clearly the strongest region in the world right now. Europe is strong, but not as strong. As a global cruise company, you do have to deal with a whole lot of stuff, including the fallout from the unrest in the Middle East and the Red Sea restrictions that have now been placed. So, there's some voyages here and there that have had to be moved around the world, and certainly there's going to be a pricing impact there, but I would argue certainly you showed the more recent private movement. If you were to take that back to 2019, these stocks have, at best, held serve or at best flat for 2019 relative to a market that's up dramatically.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
