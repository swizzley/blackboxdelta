The company has been a huge beneficiary of AI, with the stock up nearly 40% so far in 2024. In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton, Palantir CEO Alex Karp explains how the company's AI work is providing value for both customers and investors. \"The large language model is much more like a chemistry experiment. The outgrowth of which is something that is useful when refined. And the refinement of that for your enterprise happens in what we call our ontology, which is where we impose the logic of your business on the large language model in the security and intellectual logic of your business. And this is transformative. And what it means for investors and others is there is value in this market.\" On the 2024 election, Karp says that, in the past, it hasn't made much of an impact on Palantir who controls the White House. But what has changed is how the US Department of Defense is spending its money. \"The DOD wants to move quicker,\" Karp says, in a bid to stay ahead of adversaries. Karp argues there is \"only one way to fight\" deadly adversaries and that is \"with a deadly set of weapons.\" Karp explains, \"My version of fighting is you're so strong, you're so willing to fight, they don't fight you.... You want peace in the world? You have a lot of growth in America and you have really deadly weapon systems. And you tell your adversaries, 'You know what? I just might use them. I'm not even gonna explain why I'll use them. You start acting up, I will use them.'\"","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-ai-183451518.html"},{"category":"company","date":1717675380,"headline":"PLTR Stock Alert: Get Ready for Palantir Customer, Product Announcements Today","id":128123057,"image":"","symbol":"PLTR","publisher":"InvestorPlace","summary":"Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?
