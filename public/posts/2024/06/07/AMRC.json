Either data center build-outs and (likely) GPU consumption have to slow — or the deployment of energy resources that will power them has to accelerate in a big way.\" Gianarikas says there are plans to add energy capacity through solar and, longer-term, nuclear, mentioning NuScale (SMR) as a potential beneficiary. Gianarikas also thinks companies like Ameresco (AMRC) and Fluence Energy (FLNC) could benefit from higher energy demand. He also highlights Generac (GNRC) in case increased power outages spur more demand for generators.
