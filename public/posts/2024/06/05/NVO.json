Ro CEO Zach Reitano joins Asking for a Trend to shed light on how his company aims to make supply information more readily available to patients in need. Reitano underscores Ro's core mission of \"building goal-oriented healthcare\" tailored to the individual needs of its patients. Recently, the company has been dedicating its efforts to addressing obesity, but they have also recognized \"a massive shortage\" in the availability of GLP-1 drugs. Consequently, Ro has been proactively \"building products and services to help patients navigate and manage through these supply challenges.\" Reitano characterizes the current US healthcare landscape as \"one of one,\" noting that \"never before in healthcare has the majority of the US population been eligible for a drug.\" This situation has led to patients and providers \"desperately\" wanting access to these therapies, resulting in severe supply-demand dynamics, a challenge Reitano believes could persist for years to come. Reitano explains Ro's goal is to \"crowdsource\" supply information with its tracker, streamlining the process of accessing these drugs for both patients and healthcare providers.
