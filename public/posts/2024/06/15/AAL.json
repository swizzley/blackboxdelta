However, the ongoing issues facing Boeing (BA) are preventing airlines from accessing new planes, stunting growth amid high demand. Peter McNally, Third Bridge Global's head of industrials, materials, and energy sector, and George Ferguson, Bloomberg Intelligence senior aerospace defense and airlines industry analyst, join Market Domination to discuss the state of the airline industry as the summer travel season heats up. \"Capacity is growing; it's just not growing as fast as the airlines hope. And you've got companies like United (UAL) who've got very ambitious targets out to 2026 that they've had to temper that a bit... It doesn't seem like Boeing's problems are going to be sorted anytime soon, and it's not like Airbus (AIR.PA) can go any faster than they already are,\" McNally explains. Ferguson states that the record travel is due to airlines putting up record schedules, adding, \"Thank God they can't get all those airplanes because they crushed margins even more.\" McNally points to labor costs making airlines less profitable than they were pre-pandemic and believes that Delta Air Lines (DAL) is among those handling the issue best: \"The unappreciated asset that Delta has is their tech ops business that allows them to do their own maintenance, repair, and overhaul.\" Ferguson adds that retirements in the industry will peak in 2026 and 2027, which could cause a pilot shortage.
