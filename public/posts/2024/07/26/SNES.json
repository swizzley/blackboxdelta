When interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money, increasing their cost of capital.

If interest rates increase, borrowing costs rise, reducing the company's profitability. Higher borrowing costs can also result in reduced earnings and cash flow, which can negatively impact the company's stock performance."},{"section":"Investor sentiment","text":"Interest rate fluctuations can also influence investor sentiment towards Senestech Inc stock. When interest rates rise, fixed-income investments such as bonds become more attractive compared to stocks, as they offer higher returns without the same level of risk. Consequently, some investors may shift their investments away from stocks, including Senestech Inc, leading to a decrease in demand and stock prices."},{"section":"Economic conditions","text":"Interest rate fluctuations are often an indicator of changes in overall economic conditions. If interest rates rise due to expectations of a strong economy, Senestech Inc may benefit from improved consumer spending and market conditions, which can positively impact stock performance and valuation.
