Collaborative Efforts","text":"Given the shared risks within the industry, Charles River Laboratories and its peers can benefit from collaborative cybersecurity efforts. Sharing threat intelligence, best practices, and lessons learned can help enhance the overall resilience of the industry against cyber threats. Collaboration can also strengthen the ability to respond to emerging threats and improve the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures."},{"section":"8.
