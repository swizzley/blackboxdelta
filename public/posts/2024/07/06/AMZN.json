Victor Cossel, Seaport Research Partners senior macro and equity strategist, joins Market Domination to offer guidance on navigating this sector. Cossel reflects on the sector's journey, noting that software stocks faced negative sentiment early in the year. Many investors believed that \"AI would disintermediate\" numerous companies in this space. However, Cossel argues that this sentiment has been \"overdone,\" pointing to the continued strong performance of industry leaders like Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE). Turning to market dynamics, Cossel highlights emerging trends: \"We're seeing a lot of familiar reversal patterns in software stocks.\" He adds, \"It's the reversal formation that really caught our attention. The prior consolidation that... springboards to the upside.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

The trading session is shortened today in lieu of the July 4th holiday. Madison Mills and Brad Smith sift through the leading market stories and economic themes in today's episode of Catalysts. For starters, June's Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data fell short of economist expectations. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) services index registered at 48.8, below the anticipated 52.7. S\u0026P Global Ratings chief global economist Paul Gruenwald joins the show in-studio to tackle what the latest PMI print and other economic data may say about the Federal Reserve's willingness to cut interest rates. Brownstein shareholder and co-chair of financial services practice Leah Dempsey discusses the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Chevron deference, which for nearly 40 years required courts to defer to government agencies' interpretations of ambiguous laws rather than interpreting them independently. Other top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform include Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN).
