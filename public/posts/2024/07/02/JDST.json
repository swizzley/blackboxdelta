Profit potential: JDST is an inverse ETF that aims to provide investors with returns that are negatively correlated to the performance of gold mining companies. If the gold mining sector underperforms, JDST has the potential to generate significant profits."},{"section":"Potential Benefits","text":"2. Diversification: Holding JDST stock can provide investors with diversification benefits as it offers exposure to the inverse performance of gold mining companies. This can help mitigate risk in a portfolio that is heavily weighted towards traditional equities."},{"section":"Potential Benefits","text":"3.

Short-term focus: JDST is primarily designed for short-term trading strategies rather than long-term investing.
