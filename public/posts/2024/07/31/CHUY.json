Gargiulo says that the move \"makes sense\" for Darden as it grows in the full-service restaurant category. \"Despite the scale, you might be structurally constrained in your ability to grow with your existing brands. And clearly, Darden has a pathway toward this growth. But adding something onto their portfolio of brands, which is a little bit faster growing versus their Longhorn and versus their Olive Garden, will be boosting the long-term algorithm for Darden,\" Gargiulo says. He believes the acquisition will enable the company to reach a higher scale and create \"better synergies and better access to their consumers.\" While consumers continue to grapple with inflationary pressures, Gargiulo believes a pullback will be \"the hottest theme of the second quarter\" for the restaurant industry. \"All eyes and ears are going to be on whether the consumer ability to spend is decreasing more recently. I think from what we've been hearing from various companies, the challenge remains on the low end of the consumer spectrum.
