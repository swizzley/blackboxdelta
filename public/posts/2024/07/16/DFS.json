Compliance Costs","text":"The introduction of new regulations or changes in existing ones can increase compliance costs for Discover Financial Services.

Portales Partners founder and Wall Street Beats partner Charlie Peabody comes on Market Domination to talk about the prevalent themes emerging in bank earnings, such as net interest income figures \"Short term, there's momentum in the capital markets. And so Goldman is a good momentum play, but we argue that their earnings stream remains much more cyclical than the market is valuing them at,\" Peabody states. \"And that's the big debate out there in management as they moved away from their failed consumer banking strategy back to their roots as an investment bank, have been trying to convince the street that there is a core underlying earnings power that's sustainable and stable. And I don't believe them.\" Peabody also looks ahead to the bank earnings due out this week, such as Morgan Stanley (MS): \"I think it's going to be more of the same — strong, investment banking with an eye towards a pick up in M\u0026A and IPOs in the second half of the year.

However, Cooper points out, \"the real issue is private equity.\" He explains that this segment of the market has not yet reached \"that equilibrium point\" between buyers' and sellers' expectations. \"There are an unprecedented number of assets owned by private equity that are slated for sale, but are not getting done because of price discrepancy. It's really going to be an issue of just accepting what the new price reality is,\" Cooper told Yahoo Finance.
