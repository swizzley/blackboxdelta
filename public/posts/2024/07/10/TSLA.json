Bullish Breakout and Price Surge (2020-2021)","text":"In 2020, Tesla's stock witnessed a strong bullish breakout and a remarkable price surge. The stock rallied significantly, driven by positive market sentiment, increased vehicle deliveries, profitability improvements, and inclusion in major indices. Technical traders could have benefited from trend-following strategies to capture the upward momentum and potentially ride the stock's impressive gains."},{"section":"4.

RSI and Momentum Indicators","text":"Technical traders may also consider using momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), to determine overbought or oversold conditions. High RSI values suggest a potentially overbought situation, which may indicate a reversal or corrective price movement. Conversely, low RSI values may suggest an oversold condition, potentially signaling a buying opportunity."},{"section":"8. Caution and Risk Management","text":"While technical analysis can provide valuable insights, it is essential for technical traders to exercise caution and implement risk management strategies.

Many pros think a cooling US economy and waning inflation set the stage for a barrage of interest rate cuts starting in the fall. And with those lower interest rates, a land of even higher stock prices for top names such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are unlocked. But is that just wishful thinking? Should investors think through this one more rationally?  Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is leading in the polls versus sitting President Joe Biden, reigniting what is known as the “Trump Trade” on Wall Street. It also has people calling out danger ahead for the economy. On the latest episode of Opening Bid, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Editor Brian Sozzi chats with Fed Watch Advisors Founder and Chief Investment Officer Ben Emons.

Meanwhile, the S\u0026P 500 and Nasdaq Composite set new record highs to close out July's first trading week. State Street Global Markets macro multi-asset strategist Cayla Seder breaks down the markets' movement as June's jobs report marked the latest sign of economic cooling. She explains, \"We have this kind of moderation that's going on... but the actual level is still quite strong. And so I think what that means is as we're assessing this data, we have to put some of this moderation into context. And so, yes, you have a headline figure in the NFP [nonfarm payroll] print today that was still above pre-COVID norms. But then you do see some signs of weakness underneath.\" Automakers continue to report sales growth, prompting investors to question whether this trend can persist into the second half of 2024. Cox Automotive executive analyst and senior director of economic and industry insights Erin Keatin calls the auto industry's performance \"pretty good\" in 2024 despite economic uncertainty that pointed to a potential slowdown. Addressing the electric vehicle (EV) sector, she notes that \"a lot of the decline\" in the EV market \"is coming out of the Tesla (TSLA) share,\" noting Tesla's former position as the sole competitor in the market.

Sozzi and Smith explore the potential ramifications of this merger on the luxury retail landscape. The focus then shifts to analyzing stock reactions of trending tickers. Notably, Tesla (TSLA) shares have surged by an impressive 20%, while Evercore ISI analysts maintain a bullish sentiment on Apple (AAPL). In the wake of the Labour Party's big win over in Britain, Rabobank's head of FX strategy Jane Foley joins the show to discuss the implications of this political shift for the UK economy.

The trading session is shortened today in lieu of the July 4th holiday. Madison Mills and Brad Smith sift through the leading market stories and economic themes in today's episode of Catalysts. For starters, June's Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data fell short of economist expectations. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) services index registered at 48.8, below the anticipated 52.7. S\u0026P Global Ratings chief global economist Paul Gruenwald joins the show in-studio to tackle what the latest PMI print and other economic data may say about the Federal Reserve's willingness to cut interest rates. Brownstein shareholder and co-chair of financial services practice Leah Dempsey discusses the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Chevron deference, which for nearly 40 years required courts to defer to government agencies' interpretations of ambiguous laws rather than interpreting them independently.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive director of industry insights, joins Catalysts to give insight into what can drive the growth of EV sales. Valdez Streaty points one hill that the EV market must climb to increase sales: \"As you can imagine, affordability is always the top barrier. If you think about more options for consumers, if we can have more affordable EVs, that's going to be a game changer. Right now, the average transaction price for an EV is close to 50,000, 54,000, and so that's price premium over an internal combustion engine. And so I think if we can start to get more of these affordable EVs, that's really going to help. One of the things I wanted to mention for providing more affordable is used EVs as we start to see more of those enter the marketplace.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.
