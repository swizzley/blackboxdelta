And then in the event of an ignition, whether it's caused by utility equipment or not, we have a whole nother set of layers of protection. We have, in fact, over 90 former firefighters who work now for PG\u0026E to make sure our assets and our communities are safe. And so we just continue to make our system safer.\" Lastly, Poppe expands upon how PG\u0026E is using AI and how the energy grid is powering artificial intelligence.
