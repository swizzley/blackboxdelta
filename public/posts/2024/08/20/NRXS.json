Government policies, especially tax changes, can have a significant impact on the stock market behavior of Neuraxis Inc."},{"section":"Tax Reduction Policies","text":"If the government implements tax reduction policies, such as lowering corporate tax rates, Neuraxis Inc may experience positive effects on its stock market behavior.
