Dan Levy, Barclays senior autos analyst, joins Market Domination to discuss the current state of the auto industry. Levy identifies a trend in the auto industry: \"a pivot to demand constraints and away from supply constraints.\" He explains that in recent years, demand was strong while supply was weak. However, \"that's really flipped this year,\" with automakers now \"grappling with this reality\" of softer demand. Regarding the potential impact of the upcoming election on the electric vehicle (EV) market, Levy notes that automakers will likely continue with their product planning cycles \"regardless of who is in office\". However, he points out that a Trump-Vance administration could potentially change the Inflation Reduction Act's EV tax purchase credit and might lead to softer regulatory mandates for the industry.
