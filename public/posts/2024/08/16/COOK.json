Host Brad Smith breaks down key personal finance tips, from managing your portfolio amid market volatility to paying for the increased cost of college tuition. Stocks are rebounding after a global sell-off impacted major US indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC). John Belton, Gabelli Funds Portfolio Manager characterizes the outlook for stocks as \"relatively healthy.\" He explains that markets were previously priced for perfection, and factors such as a cooling labor market and the unwinding of the yen carry trade all \"came to a head at the same time and caused this drawdown.\" Nevertheless, he believes that post-correction, markets are in \"a healthier place\" regarding valuations. According to a VettaFi report, ETFs experienced their second-best month ever in July, with inflows reaching $126 billion. Todd Rosenbluth, VettaFi head of research, describes ETFs as \"a great vehicle to get exposure to the equity, fixed income, or commodities markets.\" He notes that July saw ETF investors leaning towards riskier investments, though recent market volatility has shifted focus to \"lower risk equity exposure.\" Despite this shift, he maintains that \"this is a great sign for ETF adoption.\" The number of Americans tapping into their home equity lines of credit (HELOC) has risen around 20% since bottoming out in the third quarter of 2021, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Bankrate Analyst Jeff Ostrowski breaks down a Bankrate survey that finds the top reasons why homeowners are increasingly tapping into their home equity. He notes that most Americans who tap into their home equity seek to use the money for home improvements, which he calls a \"responsible and wise use\" as these improvements tap into the life of the home. Some of the less popular reasons include using the money for a vacation or shopping spree, which Ostrowski strongly advises against. Traeger Grills (COOK) released its second quarter earnings which revealed better-than-expected earnings with a growth of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) by 25%. Traeger Grills CEO Jeremy Andrus says, \"I think it's important to note that during this environment, as things have been tough, we've actually doubled down on the two things that are sacred to Traeger owners, to the Traeger community.\" He continues, \"The first is product. We've actually we have literally doubled our product team since the end of the pandemic... The second is our community and how we engage our community and create energy and bring content.\" The price of college tuition has spiked almost 180% in the last two decades, according to the Education Data Initiative. Campus Consultants President Kalman Chany claims parents need to plan as \"early as ninth grade\" and it's \"important for the students because they're going to look at the four-year track record of them in school for awarding merit-based money.\" The author of the Princeton Review's Paying for College guidebook describes the \"two-year look back period\" for families saving for college: \"In terms of determining eligibility for the need-based aid, they are looking at income as early as January 1 of the tenth grade.\" This post was written by Melanie Riehl","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tips-managing-portfolio-paying-college-173933591.html"},{"category":"company","date":1723048041,"headline":"We acknowledge its a tough consumer environment: Traeger CEO","id":129207255,"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dveWENZkSgcDT.Q3qeNA3g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/36edd390-54be-11ef-bcfb-4eaf47749bc5","symbol":"COOK","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"Traeger Grills (COOK) released its second quarter earnings which revealed better-than-expected earnings with a growth of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) by 25%.
