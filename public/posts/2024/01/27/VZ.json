As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year. The advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. \"I found it's a real productivity increase,\" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. \"Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better.\" Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, \"Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at.\" Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, \"We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability.\" The popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, \"I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network.\" Novartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, \"We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons.\" Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the trajectory of AI and the impact it will have across the industry. Robbins said, \"I think the ones that are going to win are the ones that figure out how do I create value based capabilities that help end users take advantage of the data they have.\" Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff believes that we will one day have AI employees, but we are not there yet. Benioff said, \"There's no question that where AI is going is digital employees ... in today's world that's not where AI is. We know that AI has got a lot of problems still.\" Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon broke down the state of the semiconductor sector given the surge in AI demand. Amon explained, \"It's so exciting we did something that is very unique. We can run those large language models on your phone, and you can do them very fast.\" Microsoft has plans to expand its AI capabilities. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said, \"I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect ... it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime, certainly this decade I think without question.\" C3.ai (AI) Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel discussed his expectations for AI products as more companies pivot into the space. Siebel said, \"Generative AI changes everything. It fundamentally changes the nature of the human-computer interface as it relates to enterprise application software, and this is big.\" Williams-Sonoma (WSM) is utilizing AI in its email marketing as well as its supply chain optimization. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber explained, \"We're seeing great benefit on the supply chain side being optimized. And we can optimize it for time, or we can optimize it for cost.\" Grammy Award-winning musician and entrepreneur will.i.am announced a new radio show he will be co-hosting with an AI co-host. Will.i.am explained, \"It's trained on the world's information ... and I think that's the way to really educate people on where we are.\" Video highlights: 00:00:03 - Bill Gates 00:00:22 - Nasdaq CEO and President Adena Friedman 00:00:38 - Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan 00:00:58 - Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg 00:01:11 - Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan 00:01:32 - Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins 00:01:48 - Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff 00:02:02 - Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon 00:02:26 - Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith 00:02:47 - C3.ai Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel 00:03:02 - Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber 00:03:19 - will.i.am","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bill-gates-am-top-execs-214300704.html"},{"category":"company","date":1705695180,"headline":"The Stock Market Doesn’t Care About the Slow Start to Earnings Season","id":125188087,"image":"https://images.barrons.com/im-87548056/social","symbol":"VZ","publisher":"MarketWatch","summary":"Unimpressive profit reports haven’t mattered yet as the S\u0026P 500 rallied to a new all-time high.","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/the-stock-market-doesnt-care-about-the-slow-start-to-earnings-season-dd38e4c7"},{"category":"company","date":1705682280,"headline":"Verizon Communications Inc. stock rises Friday, still underperforms market","id":125191087,"image":"https://images.mktw.net/im-220105/social","symbol":"VZ","publisher":"MarketWatch","summary":"Shares of Verizon Communications Inc. rallied 1.00% to $39.33 Friday, on what proved to be an all-around great trading session for the stock market, with the...","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/data-news/verizon-communications-inc-stock-rises-friday-still-underperforms-market-f95add33-f2840178a708"},{"category":"company","date":1705676400,"headline":"Four Corners Property Trust: A Sleeper REIT You Should Add To Your Watchlist","id":125175768,"image":"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/477583982/image_477583982.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536","symbol":"VZ","publisher":"SeekingAlpha","summary":"Four Corners Property Trust has been impressively growing its portfolio with record acquisitions in Q3.

Here are some of the highlights. Former Microsoft President \u0026 CEO Bill Gates (00:00:03) Former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates discusses how when there are new technologies, they can be used to achieve both positive and negative things. “AI can be used… for cyberattacks, it can be used to design a bioterrorism weapon…. Whenever we have new technologies, they’re used to achieve positive goals and… for some challenging things as well,” Gates notes. “When we computers, books, video games... we had to think… what’s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those… negative things.” Nasdaq CEO \u0026 President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that “AI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you’ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.” Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta’s AI products have benefited advertisers. “Back in ’22, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite. And what were seeing now, is that our advertisers on the whole are using at least one of those products. And the reason they’re doing that is because it’s giving them better targeting and better performance,” Mendelsohn explains. Verizon Chairman \u0026 CEO Hans Vestberg (00:01:14) Verizon (VZ) Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg notes that “generative AI will be important for our... business.” “When it comes to AI, especially the generative AI and things like that, I think at the edge of the network it’s going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions, very close to the... end use, to the customer or the enterprise.” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet (00:01:41) Accenture (ACN) CEO Julie Sweet explains “what’s really important is to understand how is the gen AI going to change your talent, what are the new skills, and then… how do you make sure that we can bring people along the journey to get those new jobs.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff (00:01:57) Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff notes the “exciting opportunities” that come with AI. “I’m trying to tell stories and explain to customers what we’re seeing with AI. And I think that as we have been… traveling around we see so many exciting opportunities with AI that customers are going to get much higher margins,” Benioff says. “Right now AI can really… make people a lot better.” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins (00:02:16) Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discusses how AI will impact the company. “I think it’s incredibly early… with AI right now,” Robbins says. “As this AI thing explodes, my expectation is that our infrastructure equipment that goes with it, will also go up. KPMG US Chair \u0026 CEO Paul Knopp (00:02:26) KPMG US Chair \u0026 CEO Paul Knopp explains that “76 percent of millennials and Gen Z said that generative AI already impacts their professional lives in a big way and that they’re not concerned about job displacement. But I think that really means is they understand the technology and they also know that it’s the future. And that it’s actually mainstream at this point.” “It really is getting to the point where we’re nearing industrialization and a lot of companies are already using it in certain applications of their business,” Knopp adds. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan (00:02:59) Novartis (NVS) CEO Vasant Narasimhan explains how AI will impact the company’s drug development. “Impacting the next five years, is how AI is going to impact many of our productivity efforts in drug development. How fast can we generate new trial protocols, how fast can we work with regulators, how fast can we look at patient safety, look at large patient data sets,” Narasimhan notes. “It is generative AI, but maybe not the most cutting-edge generative AI.” Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, \u0026 CEO Robert Smith (00:03:18)  Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, and CEO Robert Smith discusses how AI “is an enabling technology just like other enabling technologies have come and… ultimately been infused into the fabric of... our companies.” “We’ve been… engaging in artificial intelligence for… well over a decade and implementing those in products and solutions and services. Gen AI gives another gear to that,” Smith adds.","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bill-gates-nasdaq-verizon-ceos-220709467.html"},{"category":"company","date":1705521476,"headline":"Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets","id":125117066,"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZxPxwmftfSJzeP73vbNqqA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/a46da9068c58072daab2f794893d76d8","symbol":"VZ","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts.
