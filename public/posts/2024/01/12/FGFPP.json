These policies and tariffs are intended to protect domestic industries, safeguard national security interests, and promote fair competition in international trade."},{"section":"Impact on FG Financial Group Inc stock","text":"The impact of global trade policies and tariffs on FG Financial Group Inc stock can be twofold. Firstly, the company may face higher costs of importing raw materials or goods due to increased tariffs. This can reduce the company's profitability and potentially lead to lower stock prices.

If certain markets impose restrictive trade policies or tariffs, FG Financial Group Inc may face barriers to its growth prospects."},{"section":"Impact on industry peers","text":"Similarly, global trade policies and tariffs can impact FG Financial Group Inc's industry peers. For example, if a country imposes tariffs on financial products or services, it may become more expensive for industry peers to conduct business in that market.

Additionally, trade policies that restrict the movement of capital or hinder cross-border transactions can have a negative impact on the entire industry, including FG Financial Group Inc's peers."},{"section":"Trade Dynamics","text":"The trade dynamics between countries play a crucial role in determining the impact of global trade policies and tariffs. For instance, if FG Financial Group Inc operates primarily in countries with open and free trade policies, its stock and industry peers may experience minimal disruption.
