As an integral part of the technology sector, Alphabet Inc stock has experienced fluctuations in its performance throughout economic recessions and recoveries."},{"section":"Performance During Recession","text":"During an economic recession, stocks across various sectors tend to face challenges due to reduced consumer spending, declining corporate earnings, and overall market pessimism. Alphabet Inc stock has not been immune to these effects in the past. For example, during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the stock experienced a significant decline in value, along with the broader market. Uncertainty surrounding the advertising sector, which contributes substantially to Alphabet Inc's revenue, contributed to this decline. However, it is important to note that the company's robust financial position and strong market position have historically helped it recover more quickly than some other industries or companies."},{"section":"Performance During Recovery","text":"As economic conditions improve and the market enters a recovery phase, Alphabet Inc stock has generally shown resilience and a tendency to rebound. Alphabet's dominance in the digital advertising space has allowed it to benefit from increasing online ad spends as businesses regain confidence and invest in marketing. Additionally, the company's diversified portfolio of products and services, including cloud computing and software solutions, has positioned it well during recovery periods, as businesses seek digital transformation to adapt to the changing landscape."},{"section":"Current Economic Scenario and Outlook","text":"While historical performance provides insights, it is crucial to consider the current economic scenario and outlook for Alphabet Inc stock. Factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory changes, technological advancements, and competitive landscape can significantly impact stock performance. In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, while Alphabet Inc initially witnessed a decline in advertising revenue, the shift towards digitalization and online services has presented new growth opportunities for the company."},{"section":"Conclusion","text":"Alphabet Inc stock has experienced both challenges and opportunities during economic recessions and recoveries. While the stock may face temporary declines during economic downturns, its strong market position, diversified product portfolio, and digital advertising dominance have historically allowed it to recover and perform well during recovery periods. However, investors should always consider the current economic scenario and company-specific factors before making investment decisions."}],"tags":["LongSignals","Long","Media"],"news":[{"category":"company","date":1706067298,"headline":"TikTok Cuts 60 Jobs in Sales and Ads as Tech Layoffs Continue","id":125269524,"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rZx7bsjr3U.7PwvNekM1gQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/9c3210eef16535aa061589ec83ca1736","symbol":"GOOG","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok joined a spate of layoffs among technology companies by cutting about 60 jobs, mostly in its sales and advertising division.Most Read from BloombergApple Dials Back Car’s Self-Driving Features and Delays Launch to 2028China Weighs Stock Market Rescue Package Backed by $278 BillionTurkey Approves Sweden NATO Bid, Leaving Hungary as HoldoutAn Isolated Israel Doubles Down on War in Gaza — At All CostsNetflix Pays $5 Billion for ‘Raw’ in Bet on Live EventsThe p","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-cuts-60-jobs-sales-033458610.html"},{"category":"company","date":1706045455,"headline":"JEPQ: 2 Key Reasons To Avoid This ETF For Now","id":125268823,"image":"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/175494583/image_175494583.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536","symbol":"GOOG","publisher":"SeekingAlpha","summary":"JEPQ is a high-income ETF using covered calls, reveals potential challenges in a volatile market.

As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year. The advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. \"I found it's a real productivity increase,\" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. \"Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better.\" Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, \"Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at.\" Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, \"We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability.\" The popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, \"I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network.\" Novartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, \"We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons.\" Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the trajectory of AI and the impact it will have across the industry. Robbins said, \"I think the ones that are going to win are the ones that figure out how do I create value based capabilities that help end users take advantage of the data they have.\" Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff believes that we will one day have AI employees, but we are not there yet. Benioff said, \"There's no question that where AI is going is digital employees ... in today's world that's not where AI is. We know that AI has got a lot of problems still.\" Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon broke down the state of the semiconductor sector given the surge in AI demand. Amon explained, \"It's so exciting we did something that is very unique. We can run those large language models on your phone, and you can do them very fast.\" Microsoft has plans to expand its AI capabilities. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said, \"I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect ... it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime, certainly this decade I think without question.\" C3.ai (AI) Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel discussed his expectations for AI products as more companies pivot into the space. Siebel said, \"Generative AI changes everything. It fundamentally changes the nature of the human-computer interface as it relates to enterprise application software, and this is big.\" Williams-Sonoma (WSM) is utilizing AI in its email marketing as well as its supply chain optimization. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber explained, \"We're seeing great benefit on the supply chain side being optimized. And we can optimize it for time, or we can optimize it for cost.\" Grammy Award-winning musician and entrepreneur will.i.am announced a new radio show he will be co-hosting with an AI co-host. Will.i.am explained, \"It's trained on the world's information ... and I think that's the way to really educate people on where we are.\" Video highlights: 00:00:03 - Bill Gates 00:00:22 - Nasdaq CEO and President Adena Friedman 00:00:38 - Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan 00:00:58 - Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg 00:01:11 - Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan 00:01:32 - Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins 00:01:48 - Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff 00:02:02 - Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon 00:02:26 - Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith 00:02:47 - C3.ai Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel 00:03:02 - Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber 00:03:19 - will.i.am","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bill-gates-am-top-execs-214300704.html"},{"category":"company","date":1705692674,"headline":"Google DeepMind scientists in talks to leave and form AI startup - Bloomberg News","id":125176096,"image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters-finance.com/fb2a9a7aa3f7d3d9580acb04c42851dd","symbol":"GOOG","publisher":"Yahoo","summary":"Scientists Laurent Sifre and Karl Tuyls, who have already given notice to leave DeepMind, have held discussions with investors about a financing round that could raise over 200 million euros ($217.84 million), the report said.

Tech giants including Meta (META) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are taking the lead and could very easily swallow the smaller stakeholders in the sector, specifically in the monetization of data. Nomad Data CEO Brad Schneider discusses how AI will turn data into dollars. Schneider notes that social and online media sites will instrument the first wave of data monetization, which involves training large language models, while the second wave focuses on more specific, “narrower” models that serve single functions. Large tech companies are \"the most data-hungry ones today,” Schneider explains, saying they are \"building the tools\" of the so-called AI revolution. Schneider goes on to say smaller companies will be able to innovate AI faster. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
