Citi Vice President of Equity Research Filippo Falorni examines Constellation's beer sales growth linked to its line of Modelo drinks. \"The Modelo Especial brand is the largest brand in the beer division, that grew depletions — which is a measure of volumes — about 12%. Overall, the beer segment grew 8.2% depletions, which was above what the consensus was expecting,\" Falorni explains to Yahoo Finance. \"Again, driven mainly by Modelo Especial, but also strong results in the other brands, like Pacifico growing 19%, Modelo Chelada growing 22%.\" Falorni also comments on the market share opportunities for Constellation as Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) faltered under 2023 boycotts.
