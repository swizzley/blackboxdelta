After pedestrian accidents involving General Motors' (GM) robotaxi service Cruise, self-driving innovators like Mobileye (MBLY) remain dedicated to implementing safety features while sharpening their infrastructure. Mobileye CEO and President Amnon Shashua sits down with Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita at CES 2024 (Consumer Electronics Show) to discuss Mobileye's aim to scale and broaden its driving systems for automakers. Shashua breaks down the narratives behind autonomous driving into three points: safety, rider productivity, and converting self-driving vehicles into major resources. \"Mobileye is active in all three stories,\" Shashua says, underlining the prominence of safety concerns in self-driving dialogues. \"You want a system that observes 360 degrees everything around you, and has situational awareness of everything that happens around you. And then prevents you from making a mistake, prevents you from hitting a pedestrian, prevents you from if another car is getting closer to you, your car will offset.\" Click here to view more of Yahoo Finance's coverage of CES 2024 this week, or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.
