The Biden administration sought to expand domestic chip productions via the CHIPS Act by awarding grants to chipmakers Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent months. SIA CEO and President John Neuffer joins Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita to review the expected growth for chip fabrication and foundry businesses through the CHIPS Act investments into the private sector. \"It took us decades to get to this point,\" Neuffer discloses. \"The two big numbers that I find most interesting coming out of this report are what would our global manufacturing footprint be without the CHIPS Act and would've fallen to 8%. With the CHIPS Act, it's at 14%. That's nearly the double the positive result. So... it's gonna take us years to kind of climb back. But with the CHIPS Act and with all these private sector investments, we absolutely turned the corner and are heading now in, in the right direction.\" Neuffer broadly estimates that without the invigoration of the CHIPS Act, the US would be producing next to zero of the world's chips in that 2032 timeframe: \"With the CHIPS Act... we'll be manufacturing 28% of those chips. So that, that's the kind of fundamental shift in terrain.\" Turning his attention to China's own semiconductor infrastructure, Neuffer characterizes the nation's chip industry as \"very focused\" in its output of legacy chips. But finds that China's lean into manufacturing will create an \"over capacity\" of chips that could lead to several down cycles for American chip makers. Some global officials have stood by their view that China's manufacturing push, driving global competition in areas such as chips and electric vehicles (EV), isn't going to \"fix the challenge\" in its economy brought on by deflating consumer sentiment.

(QCOM) reported its second quarter earnings results, beating analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines. The semiconductor giant's second quarter adjusted earnings were $2.44 per share, topping Street estimates of $2.32. Adjusted revenue of $9.39 billion was just slightly better than the $9.32 billion estimate. Joining Market Domination Overtime to discuss the results are Rosenblatt Securities Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Kevin Cassidy and Moor Insights \u0026 Strategy Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead. While the quarter focused primarily on Qualcomm's handset sales, Moorhead highlights the company's automotive segment as \"the biggest surprise\" in the results. He notes that this sector witnessed a remarkable surge in its backlog, increasing from $30 billion to a staggering $45 billion over the course of 18 months, describing the feat as \"pretty big.\" Asked about AI's implications, Moorhead says that with Qualcomm's new chips featuring \"supersized AI\" capabilities, he is \"very optimistic\" that a supercycle could emerge in the latter half of the year. Cassidy echoed Moorhead's sentiment, describing Qualcomm's results as \"a relief\" amid reports of weakening demand in the Android sector. He agrees with the notion of a potential supercycle, saying that Qualcomm's unique features and applications could support such a development.
