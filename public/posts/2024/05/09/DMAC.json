These cycles typically consist of four stages: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. The duration and intensity of each stage can vary, and market cycles can occur at different timeframes, ranging from short-term cycles (months) to long-term cycles (years)."},{"section":"Influence of market cycles on stock prices","text":"Market cycles have a significant impact on stock prices. During the expansion stage of a market cycle, stock prices tend to rise as investor optimism and economic growth drive demand. The peak stage is characterized by high stock prices, but it also signals a potential downturn. In the contraction stage, stock prices decrease as investor sentiment turns negative and there is a decrease in economic activity. The trough stage represents the lowest point of the market cycle, and it is often followed by a new expansion phase."},{"section":"DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc and market cycles","text":"DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc is a biotechnology company focused on developing innovative treatments for neurological disorders.
