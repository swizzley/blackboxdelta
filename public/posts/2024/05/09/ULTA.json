Orveon Global CEO Neela Montgomery joins Yahoo Finance to discuss some of the latest beauty trends and new opportunities for growth. \"We're seeing a very strong Q1 in the prestige cosmetics space,\" Montgomery tells Julie Hyman, adding that prestige cosmetics are growing at a much faster rate than the mass beauty market. Despite tightening consumer wallets, she explains that consumers turn to prestige products for consistent quality, which brands should not lose sight of. She also highlights the power and influence social media has on the beauty sector, as one viral makeup video could spark an industry-wide sensation causing product sales to surge. Alongside social media as a powerful tool for the industry, Montgomery points to Amazon as a \"force in beauty\" that has allowed Orveon's BareMinerals brand to double its sales. Department stores also continue to provide steady growth for beauty brands. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode.

However, as the trend returns, questions arise about its implications for athleisure companies like Lululemon (LULU). Barclays' Consumer Discretionary Analyst Adrienne Yih joins Market Domination to discuss the potential impact of this fashion shift. Yih notes that denim is experiencing a resurgence after nearly 17 years â€” with jeggings, skinny jeans, and athleisure dominating recent trends. She suggests that the economy is in the \"early adoption to mass adoption\" phase of wide-leg denim, signaling a shift in consumer preferences. While athleisure companies like Lululemon offer wider-leg options for comfort, Yih emphasizes that \"the actual trend is grounded in denim.\" Consequently, she believes consumers will spend more on brands specializing in denim offerings, such as American Eagle (AEO).
